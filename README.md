# Travel Advisor PHP
Travel agency website written in PHP and JS.

- For HTML and CSS I used an untitled template off of http://templated.co which sadly doesn't seem to exist anymore.
- The frontend is written in native JavaScript and JQuery with the addition of the Slick Carousel plugin.
- The backend is written in native PHP.
- I included the SQL database I made for it as well since the site is not hosted anywhere anyway so there is no harm in it.

Xampp needs to be installed to run it.
