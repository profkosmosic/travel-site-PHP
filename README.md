# Travel Advisor PHP
Travel agency website written in PHP and JS.<br/>
For HTML and CSS I used an untitled template off of http://templated.co which sadly doesn't seem to exist anymore.<br/>
The frontend is written in native JavaScript and JQuery with the addition of the Slick Carousel plugin.<br/>
The backend is written in native PHP.<br/>
I included the SQL database I made for it as well since the site is not hosted anywhere anyway so there is no harm in it.<br/>
Xampp needs to be installed to run it.
